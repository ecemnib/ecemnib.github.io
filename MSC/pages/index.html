My running theory as to why this particular accident got so much attention is because it was close to a UNESCO natural heritage site in a rich western country.

Temporarily sating our insatiable appetite for destruction before dissolving in noise, leaving us numb. We wait, begging for the inevitable break in the monotony. Begging for the adrenaline of watching a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a violent protest, live on twitter: Preferably close to home, but not so close that we feel we should do anything. \n

This is yet another story where the symptoms disguise the cause. One where the will to profit takes another punch at the environment and gets away with it. We explain it away as an unfortunate accident, the regrettable outcome of an unavoidable risk of a process necessary to the proper functioning of our civilised society, of the free market. \n

We need containers, we need ships. A more efficient method to transport non bulk goods does not exist. The question is whether the current system has adequate safeguards in place for the environment and for the livelihoods of those who have lived off of the sea for generations.\n

It does not. In fact, it does the opposite.

                        <a-entity mixin="footer" text="value: Container loss, environmental damage, and the possibility of legal liability are calculable risks. Calculable risks can be insured. Insurance provides safety, rassurance. 

It allows people to take risks with security. Would you go skiing without the reassurance that the 0.07% chance of a helicopter rescue and 4 weeks in a hospital wouldn’t come out of your pocket? No. We chose to let everybody pay 0.7% of the cost of failure, protecting any one person from the full brunt. 

I managed to get into contact with an underwriter working at Lloyds of London, one of the largest insurance markets in the world: He wished to remain anonymous so let’s call him Dan. This is his run down of how insurance premiums for cargo are calculated. 

                    1.83 billion tonnes of cargo are shipped annually, this equates to roughly 70 million container journeys, an estimated 1500 to 10000 of which are lost at sea. Taking the upper estimate, that is a 0.00014% risk of loss per journey. Due to environmental liability and the possibility of collateral damage, the cost associated with losing a container is more than the market value of the goods inside. On average, maybe double. Insurers usually double this to cover their operational costs, so lets say that the cost of losing a container, divided by the chance of actually losing it, is about 0.0006% of its cost."></a-entity>

                    <a-entity position="0.55 0 0">
                        <a-entity mixin="footer" text="value: Shipping wine? A forty foot container can hold 19500 bottles. If they had a market value of 5 euros a bottle, the cost to insure such a container against accidental loss would be about 60 euro. 60 euro for every container journey, meaning 4.2 billion in insurance premiums revenue annually: More than enough capital to cover the cost of failure. \n 
                                                   This is of course, a rough estimate. Dan wishes to stress that insurance premiums take years of experience to calculate and are of course, extremely variable depending on the specific nature of the product, the route, the cost to insure against damage to the vessel and against damage to the harbour facilities etc. As to who pays the premiums, Dan says it depends. The company handling the container at the time of loss or damage is liable, but the costs are inevitably passed on to the consumer. Some small fraction of the 5 euro you pay for the terrible headphones at Action goes into the pockets of Lloyds. \n 
                                                   The system is constructed in such a way that the people paying for #MSCZoe are the people buying the products it shipped. There is no incentive for shipping companies to pay out of pocket to decrease the risk of container loss as paying the premiums and cleaning up the occasional mess is so much cheaper than preventing the mess in the first place. \n 
                                                   The only incentives they understand are regulatory. But regulation goes against the principles of the free market. And I need those headphones.
