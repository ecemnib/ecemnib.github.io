        <h1>Distant Thunder</h1>
        <p>Distant thunder tells the tale of the events of janurary 2nd, 2019, when more than 300 containers fell from the boxship: MSC Zoe. It explores the use of poetry and immersive environments to envoke the faraway feeling of gazing into things incomprehensible, secretive, powerful and unaproachable: capitalism, the sea, eternal drowning and the corporate underbelly of risk and liability.</p>

        <p>The MSC accident was, lets face it, an insignificant event in the face of the inescapable global-capitalist world order. Accidents like this aren’t trivial, but we must critically question why this accident got so much coverage, aside from the than sheer number of containers involved. One theory: it was close to a UNESCO natural heritage site in a rich western country. It ruptured the blissful ignorance clouding many a caffeinated mind about where all the crap they buy actually comes from.</p>

        <p>Made-in-china doesn’t mentally translate to having sat, along with hundreds of identical “products”, in a cardboard box, along with hundreds of other cardboard boxes, in a steel box, along with thousands of other steel boxes, on a ship the size of the original world trade center for thirty days. Those five euro headphones on discount? More well traveled and cultured than the average customer.

        <p>The MSC accident captures an imagination of screeching metal, gargantuan lego bricks crashing 10 to 20 meters down onto the surface of a raging sea, smashing to pieces or escaping total destruction by some miracle, only to sink into a catacomb of ancient wrecks, or break apart hitting the sea bed. Some float blissfully to shore, to be salvaged by the consumers who would have bought the crap in the first place. Full circle.</p><p>It gives state institutions a chance to flex their legal muscles, it gives Frisian fishermen a spot on the evening news, it gives MSC some free publicity, it gives some teens in Terschelling hundreds of pink plastic ponies. But it doesn’t change anything.

        <p>#MSCZoe a story doomed to the news cycle. Temporarily sating our insatiable appetite for destruction before dissolving in noise, leaving us numb. We wait, begging for the inevitable break in the monotony. Begging for the adrenaline of watching a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a violent protest, live on twitter: Preferably close to home, but not so close that we feel we should do anything. 
</p><p>This is yet another story where the symptoms disguise the cause. One where the will to profit takes another punch at the environment and gets away with it. We explain it away as an unfortunate accident, the regrettable outcome of an unavoidable risk of a process necessary to the proper functioning of our civilised society, of the free market. 
</p><p>
We need containers, we need ships. A more efficient method to transport non bulk goods does not exist. The question is whether the current system has adequate safeguards in place for the environment and for the livelihoods of those who have lived off of the sea for generations.
</p><p>
It does not. In fact, it does the opposite.

            <h2 class="header">Insurance</h2>
            <iframe src="insurancevr.html" class="iframe">your browser does not support iframe</iframe>
       
            <p  class="poem">I am written, underwritten,<br> I am signed, co-signed in Britain,<br> I am checked, re-checked and sent,<br> I am profit, I prevent,<br> The consequence of accident,<br> I am safety, for the one percent.</p>
             </div>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Container loss, environmental damage, and the possibility of legal liability are calculable risks. Calculable risks can be insured. Insurance provides safety, rassurance. 
</p><p>
It allows people to take risks with security. Would you go skiing without the reassurance that the 0.07% chance of a helicopter rescue and 4 weeks in a hospital wouldn’t come out of your pocket? No. We chose to let everybody pay 0.7% of the cost of failure, protecting any one person from the full brunt. 
</p><p>
I managed to get into contact with an underwriter working at Lloyds of London, one of the largest insurance markets in the world: He wished to remain anonymous so let’s call him Dan. This is his run down of how insurance premiums for cargo are calculated. 
</p><p>
1.83 billion tonnes of cargo are shipped annually, this equates to roughly 70 million container journeys, an estimated 1500 to 10000 of which are lost at sea. Taking the upper estimate, that is a 0.00014% risk of loss per journey. Due to environmental liability and the possibility of collateral damage, the cost associated with losing a container is more than the market value of the goods inside; on average, maybe double. Insurers usually double this to cover their operational costs, so lets say that the cost of losing a container, divided by the chance of actually losing it, is about 0.0006% of its cost. 
</p><p>
Shipping wine? A forty foot container can hold 19500 bottles. If they had a market value of 5 euros a bottle, the cost to insure such a container against accidental loss would be about 60 euro. 60 euro for every container journey, meaning 4.2 billion in insurance premiums revenue annually: More than enough capital to cover the cost of failure. 
</p><p>
This is of course, a rough estimate. Dan wishes to stress that insurance premiums take years of experience to calculate and are of course, extremely variable depending on the specific nature of the product, the route, the cost to insure against damage to the vessel and against damage to the harbour facilities etc. As to who pays the premiums, Dan says it depends. The company handling the container at the time of loss or damage is liable, but the costs are inevitably passed on to the consumer. Some small fraction of the 5 euro you pay for the terrible headphones at Action goes into the pockets of Lloyds. 
</p><p>
The system is constructed in such a way that the people paying for #MSCZoe are the people buying the products it shipped. There is no incentive for shipping companies to pay out of their own pocket to decrease the risk of container loss: Paying the premiums and cleaning up the occasional mess is so much cheaper than preventing the mess in the first place. 
</p><p>
The only incentives they understand are regulatory.
</p><p>
But regulation goes against the principles of the free market. And I need those headphones.
